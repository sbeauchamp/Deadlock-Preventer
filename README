This consist of the first EPL release of the deadlock preventer by Freescale Semiconductor, all rights reserved.

The deadlock preventer is a tool that dynamically instruments the java bytecode of an application 
when running in a java virtual machine in order to analyze the lock ordering and detect potential 
deadlocks without the need to rely on unpredictable and unreliable race conditions.

By running the deadlock preventer while executing the java program with a good code coverage 
(basically covering all features that the customers are susceptible to use), we can ensure that 
the code does not contain incorrect lock order, and is prone to deadlocks at runtime.
